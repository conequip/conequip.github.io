    <h2>Google Analytics Information</h2>
    <p>
      ConEquip Parts also collects potentially personally-identifying
      information that is collected by Gooogle Analytics. The analytics feature
      ConEquip Parts has implemented is based on Display Advertising (e.g.,
      Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the Doubleclick
      Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and
      Interest Reporting). Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display
      Advertising and customer Display Network ads using
      <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads">Ads Settings</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ConEquip Parts will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable
      information with non-personally identifiable information previously
      collected from Google Display Advertising features that is based on the
      DoubleClick cookie unless ConEquip Parts has robust notice of, and the
      user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger. ConEquip
      Parts also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. ConEquip Parts only discloses logged in
      user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
      personally-identifying information as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any time, visitors may choose to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking
      with the
      <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"
        >Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on</a

    </p>
    <p>
      ConEquip Parts uses the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest
      Reporting feature to identify trends in the usage of its website which may
      be published in reports for internal use.
